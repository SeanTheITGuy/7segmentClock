# 7segmentClock
CircuitPython Digital clock with mechanical 7-segment display units

CircuitPython code to drive the servo based mechanic 7-segment display clock

My clock is running on an ESP32C3 Supermini with CircuitPython. The servos are attached to GPIO 0,1,3,4.  (I skip 2 because 2 is a strapping pin on the ESP32C3).  The "PIN_LIST" variable, as well as your Timezone and 24hr time preference should be changed in the code to suit your build and needs.
